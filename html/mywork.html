            My first job in the tech industry was at ON Semiconductor as a CIM
            Global Industrial Engineering Intern. I worked on various projects,
            many being in house tools. Some work was with C# console
            applications, but the majority of my work there was migrating SQL
            from their many different legacy reporting applications and
            consolidating them to a single, modern, and stadardized reporting
            application. The photo above is of there facility in Gresham, OR.

            My second job in the tech industry was at Garmin as a Software
            Engineering Intern. I worked in their marine department over in
            Newport, OR. I worked on their autopilot displays and other various
            marine devices, which was all written in C. I also got to work with
            a CAN (Controller Area Network) bus datalogger and got experience by
            writing a script to translate the messages from hexadecimal to human
            readable english. The photo above is of the Marina in Nerport, OR. I
            was on the back of one of Garmin's boats when we went out to collect
            some data on the water.
