          I graduated high school in 2011 and then enlisted in the Marine Corps
          for six years. While enlisted, I was given the opportunity travel
          around the world. I've lived in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
          While living abroad, I made sure to do plenty of traveling, I even
          climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, which I think I have already mentioned. I
          got out in 2017 and then started my first term at PSU that fall. I
          tried out CS161 with David Ely and fell in love with the class so I
          ended up majoring in computer science. I am in the MECOP internship
          program and am currently working at my second internship. My first
          internship was at ON Semiconductor, which I was not a fan of.
          Coworkers were great, the company was awesome, but I did not like the
          job. I currently work at Garmin for my second internship and I love
          it. I work down in Newport, OR, working on their marine technology. I
          love it and am so happy to have been given the opportunity to work
          here. The only problem is the commute. All my work at Garmin has been
          in C and Python, while at ON Semiconductor I worked with a lot of SQL.
          In general, I am most comfortable with C (I'm rusty with C++ but sure
          I could brush up on it) and Python. Something that I am not sure on
          how to approach is actually web development. It just seems like there
          is so much to learn. I understand that as computer scientists and
          software engineers we are always learning something new, but it just
          feels like web development has a huge barrier with all of the
          different tools being used.

          Parallax is an effect where the background content or image in this
          case, is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while
          scrolling.
